Dev Log – Gearbox Downshift & Final Drive Comparison (2025-08-26)

Today I extended the gearbox model with downshift RPM logic, applied both during acceleration and braking.
This improves realism by ensuring gears aren’t held too low during braking phases, setting the stage for future engine braking torque integration.

I also compared short vs long final drive setups, where there is a noticeable difference in acceleration but the trade off for top-end speed isn't shown yet. Simulation trials need improvement to show this.

Key plots:

Gear vs Time now includes both upshifts and downshifts.

RPM vs Time highlights engine behaviour across shifting.

0–200–0: Short vs Long Final Drive shows acceleration differences between gearing setups.

Key outputs:

All new gearbox tests passed:

Correct RPM scaling across gears.

Wheel force decreases with higher gears.

Verified upshift/downshift thresholds.

Exported KPIs for short vs long FD into CSV for later analysis.
